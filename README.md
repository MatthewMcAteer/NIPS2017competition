# NIPS 2017 competition
Data &amp; Scripts for develop a machine learning algorithm that automatically classifies genetic variations. This is for the "Personalized Medicine: Redefining Cancer Treatment" Kaggle competiton. This script is still a work in progress. For example the gradient boosting implementation still needs a lot of troubleshooting. Segmentation and Documentation of the different steps of the Notebook also need to be done. The current runtime also exceeds Kaggle's 20-minute limit on kernel times.
